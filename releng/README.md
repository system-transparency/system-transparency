# ST release engineering

This directory contains code and data for making a collection release
of System Transparency. The `reldef.sh` and `mkrel.sh` scripts were
used for the R.2 release. The mk-release-archive.sh script is used to
create releases based on manifest files, as introduced for
system-transparency v1.0.0.
