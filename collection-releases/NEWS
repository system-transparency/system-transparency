NEWS for st-1.0.0

    This is the first stable collection release of System Transparency.
    By "stable", we mean that subsequent releases within the same major
    version will be backwards compatible.  The ST version 1 collection
    is supported for at least one year, until 2025-06-01.

    For information on how releases are made in System Transparency, see
    https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/project/docs/-/tree/main/content/docs/releases.

    The included components and their versions are specified in the
    collection's manifest file. Documentation for the collection can be
    generated from the included components, see docs.  Documentation is
    also published at https://docs.system-transparency.org/st-1.0.0/.

    Compared to previous System Transparency releases that were more
    experimental, this collection release includes components with a few
    new features, improved backwards compatibility with systems
    provisioned using older tools and conventions, and much improved
    documentation.  Some obsolete features with no known usage have been
    deleted. See the NEWS files of each component for details.
