    Transparency. By "stable", we mean that later releases will either

    and RELEASES.md files for each component.

    manifest file. Documentation for this version of the collection is
    included in the distribution, and also published on

    Compared to previous, more experimental, releases, this collection
    release includes a few new features, improved backwards
    compatibility with systems provisioned using older tools tools and
    conventions, and much improved documentation. Some obsolete
    features with no known usage have been deleted. See NEWS files for
