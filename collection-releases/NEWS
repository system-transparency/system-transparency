NEWS for st-1.1.0-wip

    This is an update to the st-1.0.0 collection release, with
    one bug fix and a few new features requested by users. It is
    intended to be backwards compatible with the st-1.0.0 collection.
    Introducing use of a relative os_pkg_url for OS packages served to
    deployed systems (one of the new features) requires an stboot
    upgrade on affected systems, or booting will fail.

    Bug fixes:

    * stboot: When stboot is started as the init process (pid 1), it
      now loads kernel modules *before* mounting the efivarfs.
      Previously, accessing EFI variables required that the efivarfs
      driver was compiled statically into the kernel, rather than as a
      module. See https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/core/stboot/-/blob/v0.4.3/docs/stboot-system.md#init-process
      for init process alternatives and how to configure module loading
      when stboot is started as the init process.

    Features:

    * stboot: If a provisioning OS package is included in the stboot
      image, the operator can force stboot into provisioning mode by
      pressing Ctrl-C to interrupt normal boot, and stboot can
      similarly enter provisioning mode if normal boot fails for any
      other reason. See https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/core/stboot/-/blob/v0.4.3/docs/stboot-system.md#error-handling

    * stboot, stmgr: the OS package archive URL (os_pkg_url) can now be
      relative to the OS package pointer.  Avoid use of this extension
      if backwards compatibility with older stboot versions is needed.

NEWS for st-1.0.0

    This is the first stable collection release of System Transparency.
    By "stable", we mean that subsequent releases within the same major
    version will be backwards compatible.  The ST version 1 collection
    is supported for at least one year, until 2025-06-01.

    Compared to previous System Transparency releases that were more
    experimental, this collection release includes components with a few
    new features, improved backwards compatibility with systems
    provisioned using older tools and conventions, and much improved
    documentation.  Some obsolete features with no known usage have been
    deleted. See the NEWS files of each component for details.
