# System Transparency releases

See https://docs.system-transparency.org/st-1.1.0/docs/releases/ for
documentation of the current release process, in particular,
the distinction between component releases and collection releases.

This repository contains the following release-related files:

* [Release keys](./keys) used for signing both release tags in this
  and other ST repositories, and the collection release tar files.
* [Release manifests](./collection-releases) for ST collection
  releases, and the corresponding [NEWS](./collection-releases/NEWS)
  file that summarizes changes between collection releases.
* [Release engineering](./releng) scripts to assemble collection
  release tar files corresponding to a collection manifest.
