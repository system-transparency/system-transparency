# System transparency

The [System Transparency Project][] develops tools for system
transparency.

# Collection releases

This repository is used for management of [ST collection releases][];
it does not contain the ST tools themselves. This repository contains
the following release-related files:

* [Release keys](./keys) used for signing both release tags in this
  and other ST repositories, and the collection release tar files.
* The [NEWS file](./NEWS) summarizes changes between collection
  releases.
* [Release manifests](./collection-releases) for ST collection
  releases.
* [Release engineering](./releng) scripts to assemble collection
  release tar files corresponding to a collection manifest.
