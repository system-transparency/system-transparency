NEWS for st-1.3.0

    This collection release provides a few minor fixes and two major
    features: support for Secure Boot provisioning and Sigsum logged OS
    packages.  The release is intended to be backwards compatible,
    except for a new build-time requirement on Go version 1.23 or later.

    The code components of st-1.3.0 are stboot v0.6.5, stmgr v0.6.6, and
    stprov v0.5.4.  Documentation is included in the collection, and it
    is also published at https://docs.system-transparency.org/st-1.3.0/.

    Features:

    * stprov: provisioning of Secure Boot variables PK, KEK, db, and
      dbx.  Associated HOW-TO guides are available in the documentation.
    * stprov: it is optional to supply a file with TLS root certificates.
    * stboot: support multiple OS package signing roots.
    * stboot, stmgr: support for Sigsum signed OS packages.  In other
      words, it is now possible to use signatures that are transparent.
    * stmgr: new subcommands for verifying OS packages and creating ISOs
      from already existing UKIs.

    Miscellaneous:

    * stprov: improved logging, e.g., exactly what is being written to
      EFI NVRAM when and whether the different subcommands succeeded.
    * stmgr: more helpful error messages on invalid command-line input.


NEWS for st-1.2.0

    This is an update to the st-1.1.0 collection release, with a few
    new features requested by users. It is intended to be backwards
    compatible with the st-1.0.0 and st-1.1.0 collections except for
    a new build-time requirement on go-1.22 or later.

    The code components of st-1.2.0 are stboot v0.5.2, stmgr v0.5.2,
    and stprov v0.4.2 (also listed, with corresponding commit hashes,
    in the manifest file). Corresponding documentation is included in
    the collection, and it is also published at
    https://docs.system-transparency.org/st-1.2.0/.

    Bug fixes:

    * stprov: Don't add any extra dot when using default hostname
      (neither -h or -H specified on the command line).

    * stmgr: Properly assign the issuer and subject in generated X.509
      certificates.

    Features:

    * stboot: Add support for encrypted OS packages.

    * stprov: For network autoselect (-A), prefer the fastest network
      interface.

    * stboot, stprov: Improvements to logging.

    * stboot, stprov: Display and populate the new (and optional)
      "description" field in the host configuration.

    * stmgr: The uki subcommand can now produce both .uki and .iso in
      the same run.

    For more details, see the NEWS files and documentation for
    respective component.


NEWS for st-1.1.0

    This is an update to the st-1.0.0 collection release, with
    one bug fix and a few new features requested by users. It is
    intended to be backwards compatible with the st-1.0.0 collection.

    Using a relative os_pkg_url for OS packages served (one of the new 
    features) requires an stboot upgrade, or else the boot will fail.

    Bug fixes:

    * stboot: When stboot is started as the init process (pid 1), it
      now loads kernel modules *before* mounting the efivarfs.
      Previously, accessing EFI variables required that the efivarfs
      driver was compiled statically into the kernel, rather than as a
      module. See https://docs.system-transparency.org/st-1.1.0/docs/reference/stboot-system/#init-process
      for init process alternatives and how to configure module loading
      when stboot is started as the init process.

    Features:

    * stboot: If a provisioning OS package is included in the stboot
      image, the operator can force stboot into provisioning mode by
      pressing Ctrl-C to interrupt normal boot, and stboot can
      similarly enter provisioning mode if normal boot fails for any
      other reason. See https://docs.system-transparency.org/st-1.1.0/docs/reference/stboot-system/#error-handling

    * stboot, stmgr: the OS package archive URL (os_pkg_url) can now be
      relative to the OS package pointer.  Avoid use of this extension
      if backwards compatibility with older stboot versions is needed.

NEWS for st-1.0.0

    This is the first stable collection release of System Transparency.
    By "stable", we mean that subsequent releases within the same major
    version will be backwards compatible.  The ST version 1 collection
    is supported for at least one year, until 2025-06-01.

    The included components and their versions are specified in the
    collection's manifest file. Documentation for the collection can be
    generated from the included components, see docs.  Documentation is
    also published at https://docs.system-transparency.org/st-1.0.0/.

    Compared to previous System Transparency releases that were more
    experimental, this collection release includes components with a few
    new features, improved backwards compatibility with systems
    provisioned using older tools and conventions, and much improved
    documentation.  Some obsolete features with no known usage have been
    deleted. See the NEWS files of each component for details.
