# Following options controls the creation of the stboot installation image. 
# This includes the LinuxBoot kernel and initramfs, the host- and security
# configuration files and further files and paramters.
##############################################################################

# ST_LINUXBOOT_KERNEL_VERSION defines the linux kernel version of the LinuxBoot
# distribution.
#
ST_LINUXBOOT_KERNEL_VERSION=5.15.21

# ST_LINUXBOOT_KERNEL_CONFIG is the linux kernel defconfig loaded before
# the kernel is beeing built.
#
ST_LINUXBOOT_KERNEL_CONFIG="contrib/linuxboot.defconfig"

# ST_LINUXBOOT_VARIANT determines the content of the initramfs. Possible values
# are: minimal, debug and full.
#
# minimal: The only executables included in the initramfs are its init routine
# and the stboot binary.
#
# debug: in addition to minimal it includes a shell(elvish), the cpud command
# from the u-root repositore for debugging, a elvish script to bring up
# network, keys used with cpud and a elvish script to launch a remote debugging
# session via cpud.
#
# full: in addition to debug all core utilities of u-root.
#
ST_LINUXBOOT_VARIANT=minimal

# ST_LINUXBOOT_CMDLINE controls the kernel cmdline of the linuxboot kernel.
# Flags to stboot can be passed via uroot.uinitargs here as well.
# ST_LINUXBOOT_CMDLINE uses the same format as the kernel config CONFIG_CMDLINE.
# for more information see:
# https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html
#
ST_LINUXBOOT_CMDLINE="console=ttyS0,115200 uroot.uinitargs=\"-debug\""

# ST_SIGNING_ROOT is the path to a PEM encoded root certificate used for
# signature verification of the OS packages. The root certificate is included
# into the LinuxBoot initramfs.
ST_SIGNING_ROOT="out/keys/example_keys/root.cert"

# ST_HOSTCONFIG_FILE is the path to the host configuration file.
ST_HOST_CONFIG="contrib/example_host_configuration.json"

# ST_NUM_SIGNATURES defines the minimum number of signatures that must be valid
# in order to boot the operation system. The value is saved in the security
# configuration file inside the LinuxBoot initramfs.
#
ST_NUM_SIGNATURES=2

# ST_BOOT_MODE controlls wether the OS package is loaded from the network
# or from local storage. The value is saved in the security configuration file
# inside the LinuxBoot initramfs.
#
ST_BOOT_MODE=network
#ST_BOOT_MODE=local


# ST_LOCAL_OSPKG_DIR chooses the directory location of the OS Packages. Only
# relevant if ST_BOOT_MODE=local. The path should contain at least one OS package
# archive file (ZIP) and descriptor file (JSON). In addition it is required to
# provide a "boot_order" with the OS package's archive file listed in it.
ST_LOCAL_OSPKG_DIR="out/ospkgs"

# ST_DATA_PARTITION_EXTRA_SPACE defines additional storage space of the data
# partition in bytes.
# Suffixes like 'K', 'M', 'G', 'T' are supported. (case insensitive)
# A minimum of 100M is recommended. (corresponds to 100 MiB). When using
# network boot mode and caching OS packages is enabled, it is recommended to 
# increase this value in order to have enough space to store an OS package.
#
ST_DATA_PARTITION_EXTRA_SPACE="100M"
